## The Principle of OS-Level Virtualization

{% if slide %}
**Core Concept:** Containers utilize OS-level virtualization.
* **Unlike VMs:** They do not emulate separate hardware or run heavy guest Operating Systems.
* **Shared Kernel:** They share the host machine's OS kernel.
* **Sandboxing:** Linux features create restricted environments (isolated filesystems, networks, and process trees).
* **Application-like Execution:** Manifests can define default commands (e.g., `ENTRYPOINT` or `%runscript`), enabling the container to execute as a single packaged application rather than a booted OS.
* **The Key Difference:** Docker and Apptainer differ fundamentally in *how* they configure this sandbox.

To understand container tools, the principle of OS-level virtualization must first be established. Unlike traditional Virtual Machines (VMs) that emulate entirely separate hardware and run their own heavy guest Operating Systems, containers share the host machine's OS kernel. They utilize Linux features to create restricted "sandboxes" where a group of processes operates as if it has its own independent filesystem, network, and process tree. 

Furthermore, because containers do not need to boot a full operating system, their build manifests (such as a Dockerfile or an Apptainer definition file) can declare a default executable. This allows a container to run immediately as a single, self-contained software package (an application) rather than behaving like a general-purpose computer waiting for user login.

The core difference between Docker (or Podman) and Apptainer lies in how they configure and manage this sandbox.
